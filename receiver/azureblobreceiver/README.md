# Azure Blob Receiver

This receiver reads logs and trace data from [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/).

## Configuration

The following settings are required:

- `connection_string` (no default): Azure Blob Storage connection key, which can be found in the Azure Blob Storage resource on the Azure Portal.
- `event_hub_end_point` (no default): Azure Event Hub endpoint triggering on the `Blob Create` event 

The following settings can be optionally configured:

- `logs_container_name` (default = "logs"): Name of the blob container with the logs
- `traces_container_name` (default = "traces"): Name of the blob container with the traces

Example:

```yaml
exporters:
  azureblob:
    connection_string: DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=accountName;AccountKey=+idLkHYcL0MUWIKYHm2j4Q==;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net
    event_hub_end_point: Endpoint=sb://oteldata.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=otelhubbpollicy;SharedAccessKey=mPJVubIK5dJ6mLfZo1ucsdkLysLSQ6N7kddvsIcmoEs=;EntityPath=otellhub    
```

The receiver subscribes [on the events](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-event-overview) published by Azure Blob Storage and handled by Azure Event Hub. When it receives `Blob Create` event, it reads the logs or traces from a corresponding blob and deletes it after processing.
